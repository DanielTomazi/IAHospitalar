Back-end code that serves as a systemic AI, where the user registers new patients, and the system provides information such as age, address, and allocates the patient to a hospital bed based on their needs. The code integrates with a ZIP code search API that returns the address corresponding to the mentioned ZIP code (The code is back-end only and was created using IntelliJ).

As part of ongoing tests, the number of available beds may be adjusted due to the implementation of GRASP and SOLID principles. You can change the number of available beds directly in the code, without affecting the rest of the system. (The default number of available beds is 1).
